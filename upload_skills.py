"""
Upload each skill in skills/ via the Skills API and attach to the right
specialist agent.

Uses `files_from_dir` (from anthropic.lib) to package the skill directory.
Each skill bundle must contain a SKILL.md at its root with proper YAML
frontmatter (`name` and `description`).

Usage:
    python upload_skills.py
