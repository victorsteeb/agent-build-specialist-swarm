"""
Create four specialist sub-agents for the Deal Desk swarm.

Each specialist gets:
- A narrow system prompt
- The agent toolset (file ops, web search, web fetch, bash)
- A skill that matches its domain (uploaded separately by upload_skills.py)

Saves the resulting agent IDs to .specialist_ids.json so create_coordinator.py
can reference them.

Usage:
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
    python create_specialists.py
